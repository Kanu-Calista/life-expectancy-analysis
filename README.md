# 🌍 End-to-End Statistical Analysis of Global Life Expectancy (WHO)

This project explores how socioeconomic and health-related factors influence **global life expectancy** using data from the World Health Organization (WHO).  

It applies **descriptive statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, and **machine learning regression models** to uncover insights about human longevity across nations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between GDP, schooling, health expenditure, and life expectancy.  

- Perform data cleaning, visualization, and feature correlation analysis.  

- Apply **linear regression** and **predictive modeling** to estimate life expectancy.  

- Interpret statistical findings to understand real-world implications.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

📊 Countries with higher GDP, education levels, and healthcare investment show consistently higher life expectancy.  

🧬 Alcohol consumption and BMI have moderate but notable correlations with health outcomes.  

🌎 Schooling emerged as one of the **strongest predictors** of life expectancy globally.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**  

- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation  

- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – visualization  

- **SciPy** – hypothesis testing  

- **Scikit-learn** – regression and model evaluation
